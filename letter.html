        <p class="salutation">Dear Shreya,</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Christmas 2025… look how far we’ve come.</strong>
          It’s hard to believe we started talking heavily over two years ago, and still
          rarely can handle a day apart.
        </p>

        <p>
          I just want to start off by telling you how lucky I am to have you in my life.
          You make me a better person, you bring enjoyment, you share in my interests and
          help me find new interests through you. It’s a special bond we have that I
          couldn’t be happier with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without you, I fear life would be much too bleak. I hope I bring even a fraction
          of that joy and hopefulness to your life that you provide me, and I’ll keep
          working to make you feel that way for the rest of our lives.
        </p>

          I hope you found my Jeopardy game fun — I thought it was a neat idea!
          It combines your love of trivia with my love of doing cool computer science stuff.
          Turned out the coding was the easiest part <em>(thanks ChatGPT)</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The real struggle was coming up with good categories and questions, as well as
          choosing the right “score needed to unlock the letter.” Thankfully, you made it
          here — so the bar must’ve been set just right.
        </p>

          Looking backwards over this year, there have been many challenges — for us
          individually, together, and globally. I think the whole world can agree that
          we’re happy to put 2025 in the past, and I’m hopeful for what 2026 has to offer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking forward, we have a lot coming in the next year. You’ll get your first
          full-time job (Q4 is the worst time for hiring, by the way — start of the new year
          is when it happens). I’ll hopefully get a promotion and earn my Azure AI
          certification.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ll either be making bank while living with your parents, or you’ll have your
          first apartment as a working woman. I’ll finally get to play <em>Half-Life 3</em>
          (please God), and you’ll be able to leave the country by the end of 2026.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some excellent times to look forward to. And even with all of the struggles of
          this year, I am happy with you. Things are great. I feel safe — and I cherish
          that feeling.
        </p>

        <hr class="letterDivider" />

        <p class="closing">
          So anyways, I’m so happy to have you in my life. I’m looking forward to what comes
          next — and most importantly,
          <strong>I love you, Shreya.</strong>
